What I Have to Do --
- For each bin of each input, need to find the probability that the apple is good given that 
  the input is in that bin

Storing Probabilites --
- array of dictionaries with a length of equivalent to the number of bins
- Each dictionary will be of the form (field, prob) where field is an input category and prob
  is the probabilty that the apple is good given that the input is contained within that bin
